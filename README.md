# Unity Essentials
A package for the Unity game engine that brings a few features I found handy during game development.

## Installation
Simply open the package manager and add a package from git URL: ``https://github.com/NotRewd/Unity-Essentials.git``

## Key Features
There are various features that focus on different aspects of the game engine. Managing game folders, easy way to create in-game sounds with code, handy editor tools and more.

### Game Directories
Game Directories helps you manage and visualize persistent game folders.
A simple editor window that handles all the necessary boilerplate code for creating persistent game folders, so you don't have to touch any code and shows everything in a single place.

### Game Sounds
<p>Game Sounds allows you to create game audio during runtime using only a few lines of code. No more messing around with a bunch of audio sources.</p>

```cs
using Essentials.Core.GameSounds;
using UnityEngine;

public class PlayASound : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private AudioClip _audioClip;
    private void Start() => GameSounds.PlaySound(_audioClip);
}
```

### Databases
Essentials Databases allows you to have all of your scriptable objects at one place. No more searching for scriptable objects and making various workarounds for fetching them during runtime.
