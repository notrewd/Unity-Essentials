Transformation is a feature focused on transforming objects. It has currently only one use case and that is snapping objects to other nearby objects. You can access the Transformation in the **Essentials >> Transformation** menu.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the options are greyed out, check if the selected object has a collider attached to it. The same goes for the surface you want to snap it onto.
